\title{Distribution (PDF, CDF, PMF) and its parameters for epidemiological
characteristics of a pathogen}
\usage{
epidist(
  pathogen,
  delay_dist = c("incubation", "onset_to_admission", "onset_to_death", "serial_interval",
    "generation_time"),
  study = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pathogen}{A \code{character} specifying pathogen of interest}

\item{delay_dist}{A \code{character} specifying type of parameter: \code{"incubation"},
\code{"onset_to_admission"}, \code{"onset_to_death"}}

\item{study}{A \code{character} specifying dataset to use. Defaults to study
with largest sample size.}
}
\value{
Produces an object of class \code{epidist} which is composed of:
\itemize{
\item \code{pathogen}: The pathogen of interest
\item \code{dist}: The best-fit distribution from the literature, either from the
study with the largest sample size (default) or a specific study (using the
\code{study} argument)
\item \code{delay_dist}: The metric of interest, could be either "incubation",
"onset_to_admission", or "onset_to_death"
\item \code{param}: The parameters of the distribution
\item \code{pmf}, \code{pdf}, \code{cdf}: The distributions: probability mass function (\code{pmf}),
probability density function (\code{pdf}) and cumulative distribution function
(\code{cdf})
}
}
\description{
Parametric probability distribution (lognormal, gamma, or weibull) for the
epidemiological characteristics (incubation period, onset to admission,
onset to death, and serial interval) of various pathogens. The distributions
and associated best-fit parameters can be used to inform modelling and
estimation of other epidemiological metrics (e.g. reproduction number) and
public health decisions (e.g. quarantine period).
}
\examples{
# list_distributions() will show which pathogens are available for each
# metric here we search for which incubation periods are available
list_distributions(delay_dist = "incubation")

# example of epidist() using incubation period for ebola
epidist(pathogen = "ebola", delay_dist = "incubation")

# when more than one study is available in the database a study can be
# specified
epidist(
  pathogen = "MERS_CoV",
  delay_dist = "incubation",
  study = "Cauchemez_et_al"
)

# example using onset to admission as the metric
epidist(pathogen = "ebola", delay_dist = "onset_to_death")
