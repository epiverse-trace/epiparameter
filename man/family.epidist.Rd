\title{Family method for the \verb{<epidist>} class}
\usage{
\method{family}{epidist}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An \verb{<epidist>} object.}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to methods.}
}
\value{
A character string with the name of the distribution, or \code{NA} when
the \verb{<epidist>} object is unparameterised.
}
\description{
The \code{\link[=family]{family()}} function is used to extract the distribution
names from objects from \code{{distributional}} and \code{{distcrete}}. This method
provides the same interface for \verb{<epidist>} objects to give consistent
output irrespective of the internal distribution class.

# example with continuous distribution

# example with discretised distribution

  prob_distribution = "lnorm",
  prob_distribution_params = c(meanlog = 1, sdlog = 1),
