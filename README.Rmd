`{epiparameter}` is an `R` package that contains a library of epidemiological parameters for infectious diseases and a set classes and helper functions to be able to work with the data. It also includes functions to extract and convert parameters from reported summary statistics.

`{epiparameter}` is developed at the [Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres/centre-mathematical-modelling-infectious-diseases) at the [London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/) as part of [Epiverse-TRACE](https://data.org/initiatives/epiverse/).


## Installation

The easiest way to install the development version of `{epiparameter}` is to use the `{pak}` package:

``` r
# check whether {pak} is installed
if(!require("pak")) install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("epiverse-trace/epiparameter")
```

## Quick start

```{r load-epiparameter}
library(epiparameter)
```

To load the library of epidemiological parameters into `R`:

```{r load-data}
eparams <- epiparam()
eparams
```

The library is an `<epiparam>` class, which underneath is a data frame.

Each entry of the library can be converted into an `<epidist>` object to be used.

```{r convert-epiparam}
influenza_incubation <- as_epidist(eparams[12, ])
influenza_incubation
```

The `<epidist>` object can be plotted.

```{r plot-epidist}
plot(influenza_incubation)
```

### Parameter conversion and extraction

The parameters of a distribution can be converted to and from mean and standard deviation. In `{epiparameter}` we implement this for a variety of distributions:

- gamma
- lognormal
- weibull
- negative binomial
- geometric

The parameters of a probability distribution can also be extracted from other summary statistics, for example, percentiles of the distribution, or the median and range of the data. This can be done for:

- gamma
- lognormal
- weibull

## Contributing to library of epidemiological parameters

If you would like to contribute to the different epidemiological parameters stored in the `{epiparameter}` package, you can access the [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zVpaaKkQ7aeMdRN2r0p-W4d2TtccL5HcIOp_w-lfkEQ/edit?usp=sharing) and add your data. This spreadsheet contains two example entries as a guide to what fields can accept. See also the data dictionary (either yaml or JSON files) in the `{epiparameter}` package (in inst/extdata) for explanation of accepted entries for each column.
